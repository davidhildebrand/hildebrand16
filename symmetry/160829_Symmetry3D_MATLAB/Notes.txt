Here are the
new skeleton coordinates (everything >20um long):

Also, here is a small subset of neurons with known identities and
left-right pairs that we can check symmetry for:

Here is a larger subset with known identities for which most have
left-right pairs (also some 'unknowns' in the main/complete set may be
good symmetry partners):

Also, in case it helps, a TIF stack "movie" showing the smaller subset
positions on real data can be found here:
  http://temca.hms.harvard.edu/~davidh/ForIDAC/160803t1000_skeleton_overlays_nucMLF.tif
The question is how symmetric (over long stretches) are the neurons
with the same colored dots as compared to the others (and/or those
without dots, as the larger subset will label more of these).

I also produced a list of unique skeleton IDs to compute the symmetry
plane for the whole set.  It can be found here:
