# Hildebrand16 visualization

Included here are simplified examples for the volume renderings and visualizations associated with the [Hildebrand16 database](https://hildebrand16.link/).

All examples are implemented in [Vivaldi](https://github.com/whchoi-unist/Vivaldi_public) and developed in collaboration with [Woohyuk Choi](https://github.com/whchoi-unist) and the [High-performance Visual Computing Lab](http://hvcl.unist.ac.kr/) at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST).


## Example results
